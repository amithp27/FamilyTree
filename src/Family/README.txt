This coding solution is with respect to the Family Tree question by GeekTrust. 


Entries for KingShan and QueenAnga are made automatically during run. 
Rest of the child entries are parsed from Input.txt, as per the order in which its written.


Acceptable entries in Input.txt:
	ADD_CHILD <mothers_name> <childs_name> <childs_gender>
	ADD_SPOUSE <wife/husband_name> <husband/wife_name>
	GET_RELATIONSHIP <name> <relation>
	

Workarounds: 
	In case the program is not able to read the Input file, please make sure the Input file is located in <\src\Family\Inputs.txt>
